   <h3>History of HTML</h3>
   <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN to help researchers share and link documents easily through the World Wide Web. The first version was very basic, containing only simple tags. In 1995, HTML 2.0 became the first official standard, followed by HTML 3.2 in 1997, which added better formatting and layout support. HTML 4.01 was released in 1999 and introduced styling through CSS. The biggest improvement came with HTML5 in 2014, bringing audio, video, semantic tags, and better mobile support. Today, HTML continues to be the foundation of all web pages on the internet.</p>
